- I wonder whether spec v2 allows output of other components CSS classes? I don't think so at the moment. We could output o-form CSS in this component to make it easier to use. Copy/paste html.

- autocomplete could have a hint feature (such as the one in govuk), if we want that, we need a design for it

- make sure only supported options can be set, `autoselect` and more? E.g. showAllValues

- having the clear button causes complications with how to create the design in css/html

- obt dev should error when no brand parameter is set

- look at focus style for clear button

- Look at updating o-normalise to remove default button styles

- the max-height on the suggestions, the design showed 200px, is that what we want?
