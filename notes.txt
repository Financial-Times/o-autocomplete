- I wonder whether spec v2 allows output of other components CSS classes? I don't think so at the moment. We could output o-form CSS in this component to make it easier to use. Copy/paste html.

- autocomplete could have a hint feature (such as the one in govuk), if we want that, we need a design for it

- make sure only supported options can be set, `autoselect` and more?
