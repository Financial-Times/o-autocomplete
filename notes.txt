- [ ] I wonder whether spec v2 allows output of other components CSS classes? I don't think so at the moment. We could output o-form CSS in this component to make it easier to use. Copy/paste html.

- [ ] autocomplete could have a hint feature (such as the one in govuk), if we want that, we need a design for it

- [ ] make sure only supported options can be set, `autoselect` and more? E.g. showAllValues

- [ ] obt dev should error when no brand parameter is set

- [x] Look at focus style for clear button

- [ ] Look at updating o-normalise to remove default button styles

- [x] The max-height on the suggestions, the design showed 200px, is that what we want? -- Update: We want to have 5-7 results be visible without scrolling. On phones, we want to have the results box be fully visible on the screen, even when the virtual keyboard is open.
